# Description
 
The PDB File Analyser program extracts information from PDB files that refer to 3D structures of proteins and executes basic analysis on the files. Although the biopython library can process this file format, my objective of undertaking this project was to develop python programming skills by writing custom python functions.

## Usage
The Script directory has the program file that can be run on Python v 3.5 and above. The program can be run on a python IDE or by simply calling python on the Bash terminal. By running the script, a the menu below will be dispalyed from which a user has to enter a PDB file before proceeding to use the other menu options. The data directory has a PDB file used for testing and running the program. 

### Program menu
![05-08-2021](../Men_Layout/Menu-Layout.png)
The program prompts the user to enter a valid PDB file. The entire program is composed of different functions that process the input PDB file according to the user's choice. For example, if a user wants to see the secondary structure of a protein, they would choose option 4 which would print the protein's secondary structure.
The data folder contains the downloaded PDB file. The export function exports the results of the Information function to a txt file in the Results folder.
